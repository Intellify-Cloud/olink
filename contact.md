<!-- Gavin Young is a franchisee in oobalink Western Cape, and the owner of oobalink Boland & Cape Winelands. "I graduated from Stellenbosch University in 1985 and since then have spent most of my working life in banking at a Regional and Head Office level. I left banking in mid 2006 and started my own mortgage origination business.
My focus is delivering service to agents and bond applicants by applying all my skill and knowledge of banking to make the deal work. I have recruited a fabulous team who share the same values." -->
